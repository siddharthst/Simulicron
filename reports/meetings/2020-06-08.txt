Meeting Siddhath Wed 10 June 2020

* Issues about speed
Simulations to reproduce Kofler's results seem to be quite slow (several days). 
Apparent problem: the software takes too much time when increasing population size. The reason is still unclear. 
Meanwhile, a basic benchmark by Arnaud showed that the program was behaving as expected in terms of complexity
(perhaps the benchmark was not intensive ebnoug for population time since the non-linear behavior was not obvious). 
Online discussion about the recombination algorithm, which is in O(n) with the number of sites (and O(1) with the
number of copies), while it should be in theory in O(1) with the sites and in O(n) with the copy number. 

* Interactions between two TE families
Review of the theoretical results by Arnaud -- if no epistasis for fitness, TE dynamics are independent, but if 
log fitness is not linear, then the copy number depends on the other family. So far, this is compatible
with population genetics theory. Is it worth digging into this direction? What is the effect on pi-regulation? What is 
the effect of funny selection models (like ectopic recombinations, which are supposed to be epistatic within family but
not among families). 

* Reproduction of Kofler's results: preliminary since the code is too slow to make it easy running 10k generations. 
Yet, from short simulations and small populations, the results seem compatible (but let's wait before concluding). 

* Next time: discuss about the new Kofler paper (Kofler, R. (2020). piRNA clusters need a minimum size to control 
transposable element invasions. Genome Biology and Evolution, 12(5), 736-749.)

* Program for next week: 1) focus on performance issues, 2) add "horizontal transfer" routine to the program, 
3) read the paper.
