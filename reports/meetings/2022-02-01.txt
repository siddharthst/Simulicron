Monthly meeting, Siddharth, Feb 1 2022.

* Bioinformatics pipeline, experimental evolution: 
  - most scripts have run, locked at one point (not able to find the file). 
  - mos1 insertion data (dynamics B3, mos + peach). Todo: E2 (mos alone, one time point missing). 
  - The algorithm detects both mos and peach. -> sort afterwards? 
  
* Simulations, cross-regulation paper
  - Fig 1: done. Too much stochasticity for the central panel -> N=5000, simulations are running. 
  - Fig 2: simulations are running. Add a panel with the number of sites as a dependent variable
  
* Bioinformatics, cross-regulation paper
  - Fig 3: Different Drosophila species
           Problem with non-fll-length elements (blast isses). 
           Check the distance units. 
           Refine the data. 
           Add the I element tree. 
           Fill the rectangles with density. 
  - Fig 4: within I element. Old insertions in pi clusters? But no piRNAs for all copies (but old copies removed). 
	       check if the piRNA dataset can be reused
	       piRNA data and genome data from the same strain? 
           use Aur√©lie's phylogeny of I elements. 
           Indicate pi-clusters in the figure
           Identify primary/secondary piRNAs, sense/antisense
           Normalize the counts! (RPKM?)
           use the "sequence" dimension to show the density of matching. 
           add a schematic TE with ORFs/terminal repeats at the bottom (+ scale in kb)
