Meeting with Siddharth, 21 Apr 2021

* Done this week:
 - clean the Python simulation code
 - think about the analytical model :
    . track the site freq spectrum
    . implement copy number regulation u(n) = 1 / (1 + r n)
    . pay attention to the order of events (transposition/selection).
      expected order : transposition and then selection, but use fitnesses calculated before transposition. 
    
 * Discussion about conferences:
  - if some (online?) event in 2021 happens to be interesting, just go for it.
  
 * Next week: journal club (Apr 28) (which paper?)
