Bioinformatics: TE phylogeny and shared seq vs distance tree

Major issue : most TE families are very far apart (distances > 0.5), meaning that the 
data is full overlap for 0 distance and no overlap for distances > 0.5, with no intermediates

Still kind of a bug: large distance (> 2.0!) sequences can still share long sequences, which does not seem possible. 

Possible solution: go back to the data and use a different clustering alogirthm (distinguish more
"families"). 

Normalization: per read per kb of target TE (take the average TE length?). 

Find a good way to test the genome immunity hypothesis. Need to think more about this.
