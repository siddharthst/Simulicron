Meeting with Siddharth, Wed 2 dec 2020.

* Simulations:
 - Now a good set of simulations for transposition rates vs eta
 - New run of simulations with epistasis on fitness
 
* Bioinformatics
 - piRNA data: get datasets on ovaries (wild type D. melanogaster, origin?)
 - (filter piRNAs that start with T?)
 - collapse (merge identical reads), dust (remove low-complexity)
 - Theoretical analysis: OK; there are very small sequences and very large (wide diversity of sizes) -> normalize
 - problem with distance calculation between small vs large TEs: compute identities without gaps
 - comparison theoretical vs empirical data: this does not make sense, there is a bug somewhere. (the random looks correct?)
