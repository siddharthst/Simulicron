Meeting with Siddharth, Wed 24 March 2021

* Ultrametric trees: now fixed, no longer cladograms with fixed branch lengths
* Make sure that the trees are correct (ougroup, be careful about branch lengths)
* No real need for ultrametric trees when looking at the branch length distribution
* Focus on the branch length distribution (expected to be ~ bimodal under piRNA regulation)
* Forget about the "slopes" (correlation between branch length and number of leaves) as simulations 
  suggest that piRNA regulation should not have any strong effect on this. 
  
Next meeting Wed 31 March, except if changes in travel plans.
