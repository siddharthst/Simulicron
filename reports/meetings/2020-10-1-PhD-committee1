Ideas and remarks proposed during the first PhD commitee, Oct 1 2020. 

* In addition/Instead of the TE1/TE2 count, why not displaying the TE1/TE2 ratio, which is probably closer to what people would report from genomic studies?
* Displaying the derivative of the (log) copy number dynamics (<=> "effective u") would be very useful. This is the average u per copy in the population. 
* Discussion about whether the probability of insertion in a cluster should be the same as the relative size of the cluster. Not clear if this is important (after all, transposition is probably rather uniform, so the model does not look too bad).
* Is it necessary to implement or discuss details and approximations of the piRNA model implementation? e.g. are all clusters identical or should they have different regulatory "forces", is it necessary to have several piRNAs to inactivate a TE family, etc. 
* Difference between cut & paste and copy & paste. Look at the site freq spectrum? This should differ more than the number of copies. 
* ABC: not difficult in theory, but summary statistics is the key. Talk with someone who knows how to do it? Possibly Camille Roux, in Lille? 
* There appears to be an inconsistency in the PhD project: axis I is on TE co-regulation, but there is no experiment planned to address this. Not easy to address though. The topic of the first paper had to be shifted because of the publication of Kofler 2019; experiments were already planned at that time. Not easy to find copies that are at various divengence from a given family in the genome of D. melanogaster. There will be relevant experiments yet: 1) the introduction of a TE into some species at different phylogenetic distances (no plan to study the dynamics, but rather invasion on/off and number of copies after some generations), and 2) experimental evolution with different TE families (which does not address the problem of co-regulation, but other mechanisms (like epistasis for fitness or non-piRNA co-regulation processes) will be investigated.
