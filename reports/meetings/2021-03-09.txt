Weekly meeting, March 9 2021

* Series of bugs with the bioinformatics pipeline. 
  1) alignment problem: parameters changed, the sequence alignment is fixed.
* Ultrametric trees: trees are ultrametric but the distances are messed up -> problem with plotting or with the ultrametric function? 
* Alignments: 
 - outgroups are very far -> equivalent of rooting from the centre of mass?
 - Recent families: all sequences look very similar, no contrast?
 - In some families, akignment/assembly problems with heterogeneous distances along the sequence -> long branches in the middle of the tree
 - Slopes (distance of closest neighbor vs number of leaves) are always negative. This goes against our hypothesis
  . a) problem with ultrametric trees (?)
  . b) problem with the hypothesis (no phylogenetic pattern actually expected)
  . c) no evidence for piRNA regulation at the phylogenetic level. 
 * Need simulations to show that the expected slope is really positive.
