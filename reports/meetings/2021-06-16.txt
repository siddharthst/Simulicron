Meeting with Siddharth, Wed 16 June 2021. 

* Implementation of the simulations to back up analytical information:
  - Still some issues when calculating the average insertion frequencies (memory issues when storing the population). This should be easy to fix because one does not need the whole population
  - Interface with R : should be doable, just use the shell. 
* Paper: 
  - Target: a draft by the end of June. 
* Comitee meeting
  - September? (Anne Genissel, Matthieu Falque, Vincent Castric, Florient Maumus).
