# alignment of sequence with removing of any insertions
Parameters of mafft have been used. it is better, there are some polymorphic positions, but two groups of sequences are visible (exemple on DOC, and another element)
The alignment is made pairwise by filtering out the short sequences just before alignment, and degapping justn after.
Script has been changed to filter first all the sequences in order to try a MSA mafft alignment with reorder option, and no degapping: there is 2 groups of sequences. 
Using the --adjustdirection (aligment is tried on both directions) revealed that there is some sequences that are reverse-complement, which explains the  2 groups of sequences.
Sequences are supposed to be reverse complemented at the time of extraction of sequence from the bed file (in which the direction is indicated) (bedtools getfasta -s)
For any reason, the -s option does not seem to work.
I (Aurelie) tested on my own computer on some test file. It seems to work well.
For now, the --adjustdirection has been added to the mafft command for regenerating all alignment files. It is not the cleanest way, but it should work.

# plotting the slope against the cuttof. 
We are not sure to understand well why the slope should be negative (yet it is). 
To be noticed independently: the cutoff is reversed compared to the distance.
To be discussed with Arnaud.
