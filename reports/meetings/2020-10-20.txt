* 2 TEs with variation in eta & date of HT for TE2
 - Strange pattern, but probably due to not waiting not enough time. 
 - Wait for equilibrium to make sure not to catch a transcient process
 - Theory not too complicated: TE1/TE2 = 1 if eta*u > s, loss of TE2 otherwise. Plot eta*u = s on the plot? 
 - Explore other parameters? The theory seems straightforward 
 
 
* Bioinformatics
 - Database sent by AurÃ©lie
 - TE database (consensus) -> simulate small RNAs of given size (23 to 29?)
   . Allow for 1 or 2 mismatches
   . Count the number of cross TE -> matrix of matching %
   . Generate all possible reads, starting from position 1 to final for each TE
   . Use bowtie (1 or 2?) to map the reads
  - Point: plot RNA co-matching vs phylogenetic distance
    . Phylogenetic distances: use the protein distance for families that are far apart?
