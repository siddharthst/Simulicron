Meeting Siddharth, Wednesday 17 June 2020

* Meetings every Wednesday 9:30
* Next week: journal club, new Kofler paper
* Send reminder emails?

* New recombination algorithm
- implemented in python
- benchmark confirms that the new version is on O(1) with the number of sites, and O(n) for the number of copies (it works)!

* Still takes ~5 sec per simulation for a N=100 G=100 setting (-> further optimization). More benchmark?
