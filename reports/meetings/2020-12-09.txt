Meeting with Siddharth, Wednesday 9 Dec 2020

* Simulations: 
  - Runs with epistasis of fitness: done, but technical problem so it cannot be analyzed
  - Meanwhile, discussion about the fitness formula: explanation in references/Selection; probbaly need to fix the simulation code (so that the previous problem is not too bad)
* Bioinformatics!
  - The "big bug" of last week has been fixed (not sure what was the cause). 
  - Still some issues with Gypsy, as there are piRNAs that match TE families while theoretical sequences should not match
  - Beware of the LTR vs full sequence families
  - Find a way to order sequences according to some distance metrics; spreading close sequences in the whole plot might generate disturbing sequences. 
  - Discussion about whether piRNAs matching LTR have a regulatory potential. Do we need to read more papers about regulatory mechanisms? 
  
For next time:
- fix bugs
- discuss the outline of the ms (send a draft before the meeting)
- simulation results with epistasis
- D. ananassae results?
