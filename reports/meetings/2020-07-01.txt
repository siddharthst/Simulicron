Meeting with Siddharth, 1 july 2020

* Project discussion: co-invaion of two TE families with shared regulation

- piRNA: is it a perfect regulation process? probably not, it can be 
considered as a quantitatve process
- Coregulation: no empirical literature about it? at least we know that regulation takes place at specific developmental times, so different
TE families may possibly interact. 
- The problem of regulation in soma 

. Haig, D. (2016). Transposable elements: Self‐seekers of the germline, team‐players of the soma. Bioessays, 38(11), 1158-1166.
see also the work by Louise Johnson: 
. Johnson, L. J. (2008). Selfish genetic elements favor the evolution of a distinction between soma and germline. 
Evolution: International Journal of Organic Evolution, 62(8), 2122-2124.
. Johnson, L. J. (2007). The genome strikes back: the evolutionary importance of defence against mobile elements. 
Evolutionary Biology, 34(3-4), 121.

- Discussion about self-regulation and passive/active roles of TEs in regulation: many different cases (TE families and organisms), is there 
a general rule?
- Implementation of the co-regulation: it seems easy in the current framework (just compute a tau by family and add another loop to compute 
excision rates afterwards).
