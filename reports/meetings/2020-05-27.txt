Meeting with Siddharth, web 27 May 2020

* Presence every second day at the lab (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays)
* Large changes in the code now, turning test-oriented functions into real simulation functions
* The interface was designed to use only one TE -> more flexible parameterization
* Initialization: 2 parameters, p: the proportion of individuals carrying copies, and n: the average number of copies in carriers
  N individuals in the population -> round(N*n*p) copies to distrbute randomly among round(p*N) individuals
  simple algorithm: pop <- list(N); for (i in seq(1, round(N*n*p)) { insert_TE( pop[random_integer(1, round(p*N))] ) }

  This can also be simulated with a multinomial distribution: in R
  N <- 100
  n <- 5
  p <- 0.2
  N.carriers <- round(N*p)
  pop <- c(rmultinom(1, n*N.carriers, prob=rep(1/N.carriers, N.carriers)), rep(0, N-N.carriers))
  
* Regulation: excision/transposition rates are individual-based. Each position is associated with a regulatory strength R[i] (R[i] > 0 means more regulation), 
and the total regulation for a individual is the sum of the regulation strengths of all the sites where copies are inserted, F = 1-sum(R[i]). (F = 0 if sum(R[i] > 1).
At the transposition stage, the excision rates  are multiplied by F. 
* Comitee meeting: september / october. If it is complicated to gather everyone, let's organize the meeting with one people less.
* It is important to write the model using mathematical formulas, because we need to distinguish model and implementation.
