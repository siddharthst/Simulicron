Meeting with Siddharth, 18 dec 2020


* Simulations
  - Epistasis: all parameters fixed instead of eta and epistatic coefficient (drawn randomly)
  Epistasis < -1 and > 1 are very strong coeffciients (especially 1, more leads to beneficial insetions). 
  - plot copy nb vs. epistatic coefficient; discretize eta? 
  
* Bioinformatics
- There are still potential bugs (involving Bowtie?). 
- New dataset used, with a fly line well-identified
- UPGMA clustering for the TEs (but buggy?)
- Clustering leads to strange results. Run a phylogeny instead? Distances are too large. 
- Plot matches vs distance (direct distance from the aligmnent).
