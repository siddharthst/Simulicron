Meeting Siddharth June 24, 2020

* optimization: transposition is a bit slow, especially when excision rates are high.
- Discussion about container storages. How are NumPy matrices organised (by rows or columns?). 
  Adding a row seems costly. 
- An alternative would be to find a way to pre-reserve some space for NumPy arrays 
  (e.g. 1e7 transposons?). 

* Kofler 2020
- Overall, it makes a lot of sense
- Perhaps an interpretation issue: the parameter is not genome size %, but probability of 
  TE insertion into a cluster
- The arbitrary threshold on fitness can be problematic: extinction thresholds should depend 
  on species growth rates and life history traits
- Data comparison between Drosophila & mice is weak (many differences in both genome size and 
  life history traits). Need better data to validate the results.
- A lot of features in the simulation software are shared with us

* WHat to do next? 
- Several TEs, perhaps class I vs class II -> Interaction through fitness and regulation, consequences 
  in terms of site frequency spectrum, invasion probabilities
- Specific regulation mechanisms
- Evolution of clustrer size (raises interesting questions)
- Role of mutations in the TE sequence
