Meeting with Siddharth, Wed 28 Apr 2021. 

* Literature work
 - On piRNA: it seems that mismatches in piRNA decrease regulation efficiency very fast (so, no regulation with more than 1 mismatch)
 - Identification of piRNA activity in somatic cells in vertebrates (chicken)
 
 - First identification of a piRNA locus: flamenco (1983). It is very different to discover a regulatory locus and to identify the piRNA mechanism though. 
 
 - Theory papers : see Le Rouzic & Deceliere 2005 for review, later papers: Dolgin & Charlesworth and trap model (Kofler, Kelleher et al). 
 
* Next week: training for the EGCE talk (plan for < 15 minutes). 
* Newt science meeting in 2 weeks.
