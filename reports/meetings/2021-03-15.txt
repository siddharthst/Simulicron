Meeting with Siddharth, Wed 31 March 2021

* Clean up some family trees "by hand" (making sure that rooting and alignment is OK). Done for some families. 
* No need to make the tree ultrametric (risky because it would turn a nonsensical tree into something that looks OK). 
* Example with DOC: Unimodal, very short branch lenghts. 
* Exampe with FW: Very (too) recent?
* Copia: very (too?) recent? 

* OK: the phylogeny stuff is too complicated. Drop the idea of comparing branch lenghts? 
* Use within-family phylogenies to fill the gaps (at what phylogenetic depth do divergent copies stop sharing 22nt sequences?). 

* Draft: read papers and get an idea about what other people write about coregulation.
