Meeting Siddharth 19 Aug 2020

* New simulation results
 - N=1000
 - parameters studied: eta (co regulation coefficients), 2 transposition rates, drawn randomly (uniform (0,1))
 - T2 invades at generation 50 (1 in average per individual)
 - variable: total number of copies (TE1 + TE2)
 - problem with interpreting 4D datasets
 - eta has an effect of TE2, but not on TE1 (makes sense)
 
 - suggestion for exploring the parameter set in an efficient way:
  . 1. study u1 on TE1
  . 2. fix u1 and vary u2 and eta
 
 - 
  
 - suggestion to decide the duration of simulations
  . from the existing data, plot cor(TE1(T=10000), TE1(T=t)) = f(t)
  . pick the minimum number of generations for which the correlation is already very high -> faster simulations
 
 - suggestion to interpret the graphs; distinguish between piRNA insertions (that remain fixed by the end of the simulation) and non-piRNA.
