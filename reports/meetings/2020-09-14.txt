Meeting Siddharth, Sept 16 2020

* Simulation results for 2-TE simulations. 2 variables explored : generation at which TE 2 transfers, and eta. 
* Simulations are not over yet, but preliminary results are available. 
* TE1 starts with n0(1) = 1 copy in average and TE 2 starts with 0.2 copies. 
* Representing complex data: be careful about the number of dimensions. Do not integrate over random parameters, slice the distribution instead. 
* Proposal for a graphical representation:
 - distribtuion of the copy number at generation 100 in the following conditions
  . control: TE1 alone, TE2 alone
  . TE1 and TE2 when eta=0 (should overlap the control)
  . TE1 and TE2 when eta=1
  . (perhaps try with 2 TES at the same n0 with eta = 1?)
 - slice according to eta (0 < eta < 0.1, 0.1 < eta < 0.E etc) and display violinplots (or boxplots or just means?)
 - not considering introduction generation as a random variable makes sense. Try discrete values (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100?)? 
* Most interesting results are already there, it is just a matter of running the right simulations, find a smooth narrative, and generate figures that suits the narrative.
