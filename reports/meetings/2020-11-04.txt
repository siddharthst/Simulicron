Meeting from Wed 4 Nov 2020

* Co-regulation model: the "four corner simulations" are done, everything makes sense. 
* (perhaps plot standard deviations at one point?)
* Start thinking about the outline of the paper and the figures that will be published
* Next question: what happens with different transposition rates for TE1 and TE2? Interesting question? (probably yes)

* Bio-informatic "co-regulation" side:
* SHow that different families can produce overlapping piRNAs. 
* TE database -> chops small reads -> align agains the database
* Parameters: 0, 1, or 2 mismatches, Sizes between 22 and 29. Overla
* Normalization of the diagonal: check if it makes sense
* Asymmetric patterns: due to truncated elements? 
* Arrange the TEs by family / phylogenetic proximity
* Plan to analyze real small RNA data
* Truncated copy matching a full-length: is it 100% matching or not? 
* Objective: plot RNA match vs TE divergence
