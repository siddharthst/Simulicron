Meeting with Siddharth, Tuesday Feb 09

* From the last meeting:
  - Bioinformatics: all genomic copies. Size criterium: 200bp, high similarity with the consensus. Strong similarity requested. Focus on each sub-family individually. 
  - So far, not accounting for interrupted copies and segmental duplications. 
  
* Alignment:
   - align all sequences to the consensus. Proposal:
   - align each copy to the consensus.
   - remove all gaps in the consensus
   - paste everything in the same file (-> no further need of msa (?) ). 
   - remove the consensus. 
  
 * Ultrametric trees:
   - Pathd8 software
   - WARNING: root the tree (from the consensus sequence of the sister family). 
   - Perhaps manual inspection of the trees and/or alignments will be necessary
   
* Nb of leaves vs distance to neighbor:
   - For a given cutoff, summary the results by the slope of a linear regression (and perhaps the std.err of the slope)
   - plot slope (+/- srd err) vs cutoff
