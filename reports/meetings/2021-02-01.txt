Meeting with Siddharth, Monday 01 Feb 2021

* Decision to use the genomic TE insertions instead of consensus

Genome -> repeat M vs consensus
  -> TE list, remove < 100 bp, merge everything that is within 100bp. 
  How to deal with ambiguous matches? 
  What to do with TE sequences from piRNA clusters? At least label them. 
  
* How to analyze:
 1) make a tree
 2) make it ultrametric
 3) Slice it at a given divergence
 4) Plot #leaves (offspring) vs distance to closest neighbor at the time of the slice. 
 
Will it work? We don't know. Let's see what happens. 

* Manuscript: still hanging.
