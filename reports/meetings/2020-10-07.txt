Wednesday Oct 7. 

* PhD committee. There was a focus on covid and issues in order to keep options open for the PhD extension. 
* Servers. Misunderstanding about sharing the CPU (Arnaud's mistake). If possible, avoid Lug (more "bioinformatics"-like). 
* New results: clearer now with u = 0.1. Perhaps extend the range of generations before HT (0 to 500?)
* Initial state : start with the same number of copies for both families -> 0.2 each? 
* Simulation duration : 500 is probably too short, 5000 too long -> 2000?
* Add bioinformatics studies (Drosophila and/or other group(?)):
  - B1: connect Eta to divergence. 
    . B1.1: simulate piRNA from TE sequences and check the frequency of matching sequences
    . B1.2: consider the piRNA sequencing data
  - B2: do something about copy numbers in related families. 
    . B2.1: is there less copies in families that have close relatives in the genome?
    . B2.2: do recent families have less copies when they already have a relative in the genome?
