## Simulations and data analysis for

# Does cross-regulation affect transposable element dynamics?

## by Siddharth S. Tomar, Arnaud Le Rouzic, and Aur√©lie Hua-Van

This repository is split into two independent directories:
* **Simulations**, which contains (i) the simulation software, (ii) scripts to run the simulations, and (iii) scripts to make the figures
* **Bioinformatics**, which contains scripts and functions to reproduce the two genomic analyses in the paper.

README files are provided in these sub-directories.
